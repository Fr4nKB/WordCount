All the code is written to be run on a windows machine (the terminal commands used are not compatible with Linux)
The project is written in C++, however Python was used to plot the cumulative speedup graphs (used during the initial analysis)

Use the make file with the option "run" to run all the tests, "clean" to remove all the results and executable files
(some data set to test the application are not included)
